Part (a)
Suppose you have computed OPT(0), OPT(1), OPT(2), ..., OPT(n-1), the numbers of coins that are
needed to make up 0c, 1c, 2c, ..., (n-1)c.
Write down an expression for OPT(n), in terms of the denominations and OPT(0), ...., OPT(n).
Hint: if you want to use the 5c coin, the total number of coins youâ€™ll need is OPT(n-5)+1

Question 1) a)
we have denominations of [1c, 4c, 5c] and we want to make up n cents using the least possible number of coins
we also have already computed OPT(0), OPT(1), OPT(2), ..., OPT(n-1),
this is the number of coins needed to make up 0c, 1c, 2c, ..., (n-1)c

therefore, to determine the number of coins needed for n cents, 
we have to to use the least possible number of coins from the denominations
so we need OPT(n) = min( OPT(n-1) + 1, OPT(n-4) + 1, OPT(n-5) + 1 )
you are looking at 1 cent less, 4 cents less, and 5 cents less in terms of n, so n-1c, n-4c, n-5c
